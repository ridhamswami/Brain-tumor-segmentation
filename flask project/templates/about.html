    <h2>About Glioma Detection System</h2>
    <p>
        Gliomas are a type of brain tumor that can significantly impact patient outcomes. Early detection and accurate
        diagnosis are critical for determining appropriate treatment strategies and improving survival rates. However,
        analyzing gliomas in MRI scans is often challenging, as it requires precision and expertise. Manual segmentation
        is time-consuming and prone to errors, which can delay treatment and affect patient prognosis.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our Glioma Detection System leverages cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning to automate the
        process of glioma segmentation and analysis. Using advanced 3D U-Net models, we can accurately segment gliomas
        from MRI scans, providing radiologists and oncologists with precise data in a fraction of the time required by
        manual methods.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, our system uses radiomic features extracted from the segmented tumors to predict patient survival,
        offering insights that assist in personalized treatment planning. We also differentiate between pseudoprogression
        and true tumor recurrence—two conditions that often look similar but require very different treatment approaches.
    </p>
    <p>
        The solution aims to streamline the diagnostic process, enhance clinical decision-making, and ultimately improve
        patient outcomes. By integrating this system with an easy-to-use web interface, healthcare professionals can
        upload MRI scans, visualize segmented tumor regions, and receive accurate survival predictions, all from a single
        platform.

        <p>
            The image above showcases the BRATS dataset annotations used for training the glioma segmentation models.
            Different tumor subregions are highlighted, including the enhancing tumor core, necrotic regions, and the
            surrounding edema. Accurate segmentation of these regions is crucial for prognosis and treatment planning,
            as each structure provides different clinical insights into the tumor's behavior and response to therapy.
